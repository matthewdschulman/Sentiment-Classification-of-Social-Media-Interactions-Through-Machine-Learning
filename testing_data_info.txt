Buy a different phone - but not this.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-A
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-A
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-A
A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-A
It feels more comfortable than most headsets because I wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-A

Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-A
That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-A
I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-A

This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-A
Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-A
I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-A

This was like the final blow!|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Overall, I like this place a lot.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Ample portions and good prices.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
My first visit to Hiro was a delight!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Service sucks.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The shrimp tender and moist.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B

He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Their chow mein is so good!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B

The portion was huge!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B

We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
A great way to finish a great.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
- Really, really good rice, all the time.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The service was meh.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The turkey and roast beef were bland.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
This place has it!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
All I have to say is the food was amazing!!!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Omelets are to die for!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Everything was fresh and delicious!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
In summary, this was a largely disappointing dining experience.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Never been to Hard Rock Casino before, WILL NEVER EVER STEP FORWARD IN IT AGAIN!|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B

The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
This is one of the better buffets that I have been to.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B

Sooooo good!!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Nice, spicy and tender.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Good prices.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Check it out.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
It was pretty gross!|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I've had better atmosphere.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Service was fine and the waitress was friendly.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES!|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Bland... Not a liking this place for a number of reasons and I don't want to waste time on bad reviewing.. I'll leave it at that...|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I wouldn't return.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Penne vodka excellent!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The management is rude.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I had a seriously solid breakfast here.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Don't do it!!!!|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The menu is always changing, food quality is going down & service is extremely slow.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I give it 2 thumbs down|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
We waited for forty five minutes in vain.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
this place is good.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I was seated immediately.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Avoid at all cost!|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Restaurant is always full but never a wait.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
DELICIOUS!!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I've never been treated so bad.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Bacon is hella salty.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The waitresses are very friendly.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
It was probably dirt.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Interesting decor.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
What I really like there is the crepe station.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Both of the egg rolls were fantastic.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
The live music on Fridays totally blows.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.|-1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
Very friendly staff.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
It is worth the drive.|1|Product Review|Product-Review-B
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Very little music or anything to speak of.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Wasted two hours.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
A bit predictable.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
And those baby owls were adorable.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The Songs Were The Best And The Muppets Were So Hilarious.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It Was So Cool.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It had some average acting from the main person, and it was a low budget as you clearly can see.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux "masterpieces.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It deserves strong love.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It is an insane game.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
There are massive levels, massive unlockable characters... it's just a massive game.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Waste your money on this game.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This is the kind of money that is wasted properly.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Today the graphics are crap.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This game rocks.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I wasn't the least bit interested.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
But it's just not funny.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Long, whiny and pointless.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Excellent cast, story line, performances.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Totally believable.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I was very disappointed in the movie.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
There are some generally great things in it.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I'm glad this pretentious piece of s*** didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained "movie business" of Québec.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Give this one a look.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I gave it a 10  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It is a true classic.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Definitely worth checking out.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The problem was the script.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It was horrendous.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I don't think you will be disappointed.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The acting was bad, the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Too politically correct.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Very disappointing.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The directing seems too pretentious.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I really liked that.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
A great film by a great director.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The music in the film is really nice too.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Brilliant!  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
10/10  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I liked this movie way too much.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
All in all, a great disappointment.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this "film".  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
A truly, truly bad film.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I paid too much.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It was so BORING!  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
No plot whatsoever!  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Again, no plot at all.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Horrible!  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I hate movies like that.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Awful.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I mean this in a terrible way.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This film has no redeeming features.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Everything is appalling.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The story is beyond stupid.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The script iswas there a script?  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The kids are annoying.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The lead man is charisma-free.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
I'll even say it again  this is torture.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Highly unrecommended.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Yes, it's that bad.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Nothing at all to recommend.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
An excellent performance from Ms.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
There were too many close ups.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
"You'll love it!  |1|Movie Review|Movie Review
This movie is BAD.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
So bad.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
The film is way too long.  |-1|Movie Review|Movie Review
